      <h2>üìú About me section</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Conrad Hansen-Quartey. I live in West Haven, CT. I majored in Engineering Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having self-taught programming languages throughout high school and learning computer programming design
        principles and techniques in college, I have become a well-rounded computer scientist. I have a passion not only
        for developing software, but for solving problems in creative ways. I am deeply committed to using my talents
        and gifts to serve those around me and society in general.
      </p>

      <h2>Creative Contentions </h2>
      <p><i>(2D block world game)</i></p>
      <p>Programming Language: Processing (based on Java)</p>

      <p><b>Purpose</b></p>
      <p>This is a 2D world of block characters, where the player can break down and collect blocks, craft new items, and fight mobs and monsters.</p>

      <p><b>Contributions</b></p>
      <ul> 
        <li>Reduced CPU utilization by 42% through code refactoring to reduce time complexity of several sections of code.</li>
        <li>Reduced  
          <a href="https://conradhq.notion.site/Creative-Contentions-Engineering-Considerations-60f57e4695b14bbf94cbb73a321733a8">time complexity of multiple functions</a>
          from linear to constant time and removed duplicated sections of code.</li>
        <li>Make 
          <a href="https://conradhq.notion.site/Creative-Contentions-Engineering-Considerations-60f57e4695b14bbf94cbb73a321733a8">technical trade-offs</a>
          to balance time complexity with file size to ensure execution speed at scale.</li>

      <h2>Bee Swarm Simulator (bss)</h2>
      <p><i>(spin-off of block character 3D world in roblox)</i></p>
      <p>Programming Language: VanillaJS</p>

      <p><b>Purpose</b></p>
      <p>This is a 3D world of block characters in which the main player controls a swarm of bees. The main player can talk to characters (mostly bears) to receive and complete quests and earn honey and items. The player can use honey to buy bee eggs and items to upgrade their tools and storage pack.</p>

      <p><b>Contributions</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved readability of code by introducing comments for all edits from May 2023 and onward</li>
        <li>Improved playability of game in several ways, including</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Making all menus easily accessible by keyboard shortcut</li>
          <li>Fixed an issue where the camera panning following the mouse position prevented the user from being able to select menus with the mouse</li>
