      <h2>üìú About me section</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Conrad Hansen-Quartey. I live in West Haven, CT. I majored in Engineering Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having self-taught programming languages throughout high school and learning computer programming design
        principles and techniques in college, I have become a well-rounded computer scientist. I have a passion not only
        for developing software, but for solving problems in creative ways. I am deeply committed to using my talents
        and gifts to serve those around me and society in general.
